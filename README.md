### React learning journey.

Starting my development with a Free Tailwind CSS and React UI Kit and Admin from Creative Tim.

Notus React is Free and Open Source. It features multiple HTML and React elements and it comes with dynamic components for React.

It is based on [Tailwind Starter Kit](https://www.creative-tim.com/learning-lab/tailwind-starter-kit/presentation?ref=nr-github-readme) by Creative Tim, and it is build with both presentation pages, and pages for an admin dashboard.

I decided to speed up my web development with a beautiful product made by <a href="https://creative-tim.com/" target="_blank">Creative Tim </a>.
If you like bright and fresh colors, you will love this Free Tailwind CSS Template! It features a huge number of components that can help you create amazing websites.

### Just getting started with React

- I use Angular at work and I decided to also try React as it is lighter and faster and it makes
  perfect sense to use for small personal projects.
- As my CSS skills are not very strong, I decided to use some pre coded layout and mainly focus on JS side of the application.
